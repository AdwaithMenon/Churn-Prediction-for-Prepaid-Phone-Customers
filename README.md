## _Churn Prediction for Prepaid Phone Customers: Analyzing Prepaid Phone Data to Enhance Customer Retention for Phone Company_


### **Business Case**

* Customer Churn has a significant effect on a company's revenue.

* Customer acquisition is thought to be five times more expensive than customer retention.

* According to a study conducted by Bain & Company, a 5% increase in customer retention can result in a 25% to 95% increase in profits.


### **Problem Statement**


* The Phone Company aims to identify the customers who would discontinue service in September 2013 based on the prepaid phone data from the months of June, July, and August 2013.

* Using the dataset provided, classification models must be built that can categorize customers as 1s (likely to drop) or 0s (likely to stay or unlikely to drop).

* Understanding the traits of customers who are likely to drop the service allows the company to modify its services in order to improve customer retention rates.
